### Questions

Q1 : Which database you have chosen and why?

```bash
  I choose PostgreSQL database and Prisma ORM .Prisma is chosen for its developer-friendly ORM capabilities and type safety, while a relational database like PostgresSQL is selected for its ability to handle structured data with clear relationships and provide efficent approach to query, also SQL Databases are scalable and if relations between attributes are good then their query run much faster.

```

Q2 : 3 things that you learned from this assignment?

```bash
1. I learn to Design and implement a well-structured API for fetching hierarchical data categories, subcategories, and items using Prisma and Express.

2.  I ensure that there must be a robust error handling in API endpoints to provide meaningful feedback to users.

3. Properly handling asynchronous operations with try-catch blocks ensured that unexpected errors are caught and handled gracefully, maintaining the stability of the application.

```

Q3 : What was the most difficult part of the assignment?

```bash

1. Designing API endpoints that can efficiently fetch and return nested data structures categories, subcategories, and items in a single query.

2. Using Prisma to query relational data and include nested relationships involves the ORMâ€™s capabilities effectively.

3. Ensuring that the queries are optimized to avoid performance issues while maintaining data integrity and consistency .

```

Q4 : What you would have done differently given more time?

```bash

1. I would like to index those data to  improve query performance, especially for large datasets.
2. I would like to implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
3. I try to implement a centralized error handling mechanism in Express to manage different types of errors consistently and provide more informative error messages.
